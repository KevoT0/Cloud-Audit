# Secure Virtual Network Access Management Policy

## **Purpose**
The goal of this project is to secure access to virtual machines (VMs) in a cloud network by enforcing **least-privilege access** and ensuring only authorized users or groups can interact with these VMs. The policy follows **Cloud Control Matrix (CCM)** standards to strengthen security.

## **Scope**
This policy applies to all virtual machines within the network and ensures compliance with the **Cloud Security Alliance's Cloud Control Matrix (CCM)** for access management and auditing.

## **Recommendations**

- **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Enforce least-privilege access for users (**IAM-03**).
- **Conduct Regular Audits:** Review user permissions regularly (**IAM-06**).
- **Enable Logging & Monitoring:** Track activity and detect any unauthorized access (**LOG-01**).
- **Use Automated Enforcement Tools:** Help prevent unauthorized access (**IAM-02**).
- **Establish Approval Process for Changes:** Ensure all access control changes are approved (**CCC-03**).

---

## **Implementation References**
- **Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Control Matrix (CCM)** - Refer to IAM, LOG, and CCC domains for standards.
- **Azure Active Directory RBAC Best Practices** - Use these best practices for managing user roles and permissions.
